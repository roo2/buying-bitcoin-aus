Buying bitcoin in Australia
--
Hello friends. I'm getting a lot of people asking me about buying bitcoin lately. 
But many of you are time poor and a bit worried about doing something wrong and losing money. 
I made this tutorial to help you get some Bitcoin and Ethereum for yourself. 


Outline

* Part 1. Register on an exchange
* Part 2. Buying Bitcoin and Ethereum (Coming soon)
* Part 3. Hosting your own wallets (coming soon)

Part 1. Registering on an exchange
--
Required:
* **At least 30 minutes**
* **An Id Document (Passport, Drivers Licence)**
* **A utility bill with your name and address**

###W 0. Overview
To buy bitcoin you can either
* buy from someone you know,
* buy from someone on [https://localbitcoins.com/](https://localbitcoins.com/),
* find a bitcoin ATM,
* **use an exchange.**

This covers buying bitcoin from one exchange called, "the independent reserve". There are quite a few other exchanges but this one has a good rate, is big and also sells ethereum.

Positives:
* Good rate for bitcoin.
* A large established business.
* You can buy Ethereum in the same place
* You don't have to download bitcoin software right away

Negatives:
* You need to upload a photo of you holding your ID and a utility bill
    * This is inconvenient

    * There's a small possibility that your identity will be stolen

#### Go to [https://www.independentreserve.com?invite=KUXBHN](https://www.independentreserve.com?invite=KUXBHN) and register an account.
