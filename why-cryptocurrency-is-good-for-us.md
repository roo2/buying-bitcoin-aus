Why you need to buy cryptocurrency so that we can buy houses:

I have a theory that when more people adopt cryptocurrency, the world and Australia in particular will be much better off. This is just mine and my girlfriend's understanding and it's not exactly peer reviewed or even very well researched but please bear with me and then form your own opinions.

When I talk about cryptocurrency I don't mean Bitcoin or anything as it is today, I'm talking about a cryptocurrency that has solved its scalling issues and finished expanding to become as stable as Gold or Silver, I know that this isn't the case yet.

Current problems:

* Rent is too high
* Property prices are too high
* It's hard to save money

I believe that cryptocurrency will help make these problems less severe, let's talk through an example of why:

Say you work very hard for many years and are able to save away $500,000. What are you going to do with that money?
You have four basic options:

</div>
</div>
<div class="col-6-12>
<div class="content">
* Keep the cash (Trust account, Cash in a safe)
* Value is driven by what it can be traded for
* Looses value over time due to inflation
* Very low risk
</div>

![image](img/why-cryptocurrency-is-good-for-us/treasure.png?raw=true)
Buy rare tradeables (Gold, Silver, Paintings, Beanie babies)
Value is driven by what it can be traded for and speculation
Maintains its value over time due to scarcity
No passive income
Risky to store


![image](img/why-cryptocurrency-is-good-for-us/fences.png?raw=true)
Invest in Land or control of another scarce productive resource (Land, Taxi Medalion, Patents)
Value is driven by scarcity and usefulness of the property
Positives: 
Maintains its value over time
Generally a safe investment
Modest return on investment via rent/fees

Invest in shares or a busines(Shares on the ASX, Starting a business, Developing a house to rent out)
Value is driven by useful outputs of the business
Higher rate of return
Riskyer investment

Currently, buying gold or other tradeables is inconvinient and risky to store. cash is a bad option because you are guaranteed to lose value to inflation over time. This is actually seen as a positive because it encourages investment. But a business is a risky investment as are shares in other businesses. Buying an inherently valuable resource like land is a much safer use of your money. People will always need land and it requires relatively little management. Houses are in the same category as businesses/shares because they are more like a product produced by builders than a fundamentally rare resources.

So you buy land? Well thanks dickhead, by investing in land, you've played a part in increasing home prices and potentially just priced another young Australian out of the property market. Your money has not helped people, it has actively hurt people by making homes more expensive. People are homeless because of you! And we all have to work longer hours and pay higher rent just to stay on this hamster wheel economy because of investments like yours. 

But it's not your fault, we would all do the same, it's the only safe option when inflation is high and business is uncertain. 

But there is now another option; it is similar to buying gold/silver but with some extra benefits.

![image](img/why-cryptocurrency-is-good-for-us/cryptos.png?raw=true)
Buy a CryptoCurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero)
Value is driven by what it can be traded for and speculation.
No intrinsic value
Maintains its value over time due to scarcity
Extremely secure if set up correctly
Easier to spend than gold or beanie babies
Increases in value as adoption increases


Now that you have a secure and stable place to store value, you don't have to pump your money into inflating property prices! Before, your money was pricing people out of homes. Now, it's pricing people out of cryptocurrency. Which is fine! cryptocurrency has no inherent value anyway. Your money is not helping or hurting society, it's just sitting out this round. You can bring it back in to invest in productive businesses when you want to make some return on investment. Or use it to see the world, for a project that helps people, or anything else that you want. It's not going anywhere. 

Now imagine if more people invested in cryptocurrency.

With less people investing in land, house prices would drop.
When house prices drop rent would drop.
When rent drops, people get to save more of their money and even get to a point where they can invest in their own productive business if they chose to.
Land prices won't drop to zero, people will still need land.
Businesses will still receive investment, high return for high risk is attractive to many.

Other thoughts:
I don't have anything against people who own land. If most of your income comes from work/business, you are still on the losing side of inflation.
Inflation is theft. Banks create money every time someone borrows from them and this is unfair! It keeps you working harder than you need to for less than you deserve. When you hold cash, you support this unfair system.
Currently, businesses are expected to grow exponentially to beat inflation, this is clearly unsustainable and drives environmental damage. 
Also to beat inflation, companies promote excessive consumption such as cheap unhealthy food and throwaway culture. Not all productive business is helping people.
Currently, Cryptocurrency is driven by speculation and early adopters have an unfair advantage. This is a bad thing but it's only a one time problem, once they've spent it their unfair advantage is gone, land makes a constant return which can be used to buy more land.
Just let some of your money sit in cryptocurrency where it isn't hurting anyone =)
